# Logistic-Regression-Model-For-Telecom-Customers-

In this project we will buid a Logistic regression model for the Telecom sector , the model can help the company in easily identifying the customers who are going to churn(It is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity).

We will be looking at the telecom churn prediction. We will use 21 variables related to customer behaviour (such as the monthly bill, internet usage etc.) to predict whether a particular customer will switch to another telecom provider or not (i.e. churn or not).

We have a telecom firm which has collected data of all its customers. The main types of attributes are:
- Demographics (age, gender etc.)
- Services availed (internet packs purchased, special offers taken etc.)
- Expenses (amount of recharge done per month etc.)

Based on all this past information, we want to build a model which will predict whether a particular customer will churn or not, i.e. whether they will switch to a different service provider or not. So the variable of interest, i.e. the target variable here is ‘Churn’ which will tell us whether or not a particular customer has churned. It is a binary variable - 1 means that the customer has churned and 0 means the customer has not churned.

You can refer to this [link]('https://medium.com/data-science-on-customer-churn-data/customer-churn-data-analysis-using-logistic-regression-3861e2d4d1f3') if you want to learn more about the theoretical concept of the mode which we built.
